                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MoonSpark is a listing platform focused on providing investors with access to exciting emerging projects. Our platform’s main objective is to make investing in small or micro cap crypto projects more accessible to investors. The biggest gripe we hear among investors interested in the micro cap space is the difficulty of buying into projects. Many investors don’t feel comfortable buying through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and many others have had bad experiences dealing with exchanges operating in the small cap arena. We plan to change all that.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoQuestion has established a solid reputation in the micro cap crypto market with its weekly Micro Cap Watch List, Monthly Moonshot Portfolio and various podcasts. Our large and growing community is made up of investors with an interest in emerging crypto projects. Our new platform is a perfect resource for the investor looking to build a portfolio of early stage projects which they can buy easily and cheaply.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no commissions, fees or spreads payable by the investor.</span></p>

                <div class="wpb_text_column">
                    <div class="wpb_wrapper">
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a project founder one of the most important goals is to gain widespread adoption of their protocol. That means expanding the investor base among as many token holders as possible. With a small cap project that often proves challenging.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are valuable to the crypto ecosystem and will continue to grow in importance they are not the best solution for small crypto projects. Every dollar of their native cryptocurrency has to be supported with a dollar in an alternative currency such as ETH, BNB, TUSD etc. When someone sells the&nbsp; liquidity has to be replenished. Most small projects have limited liquid resources thus restricting them from marketing their project to a wider audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central exchanges on paper overcome this need for liquidity however it is very difficult for a micro project to obtain a listing on a small exchange, there is an upfront cost and the reputation of most small exchanges are appalling deterring many investors from participating.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our platform provides the project founder with options.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps projects raise development capital.&nbsp;</span></li>
                            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows projects to expand their token holder base with few restrictions.</span></li>
                            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides a solution for founders wanting to sell tokens.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project sets the price at which the token is sold on the platform and has control over the token supply, adding and removing at their discretion.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project owners must submit certain information in order to provide a clear and not misleading picture of their project to investors. This includes information about the project, tokenomics and a short video. The project founder specifies the price he or she wants to sell their tokens at, transfers the tokens that they wish to start selling and then presses submit.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once submitted the project will be made available for investors to purchase. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No commission, fees or spreads will be charged to investors. There will be a commission charged to the project owner and deducted from each transaction.&nbsp; </span></p>
